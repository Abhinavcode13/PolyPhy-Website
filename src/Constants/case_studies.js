    journal: "The Astrophysical Journal (July 2020)",
    image: "https://elek.pub/img/frb190608_sm.jpg",
    brief:
      "We analyze the observed dispersion measure (DM) of the signal emitted by FRB 190608. The dispersion is caused by interactions of the FRB radiation with matter in the intervening entities: source galaxy and its halo, our galaxy and its halo, and finally the intergalactic medium contained in the Cosmic Web.",

    brief:
      "The initial application of Polyphorm had aimed to establish a complete, calibrated map of the dark matter density field in a sufficiently representative region of space wherein we could study the study the distribution of intergalactic gas (the IGM) relative to the dark matter structures, or Cosmic Web.",

    image: "https://elek.pub/img/polyphorm_sm.jpg",
    brief:
      "This paper summarizes over a year of work on our Polyphorm software: detailed account of the tasks driving our design decisions, full exposition of the MCPM model, and concise explanation of the astronomical use cases. This software has been born out of several lucky accidents and seemingly unlikely connections between several disciplines. We are very excited about the result.",

    journal: "Artificial Life journal (Winter 2022)",
    image: "https://elek.pub/img/MCPM.jpg",
    brief:
      "We compare MCPM to Jones’s work on theoretical grounds, and describe a task-specific variant designed for reconstructing the large-scale distribution of gas and dark matter in the Universe known as the Cosmic Web. We first explore MCPM’s self-patterning behavior, showing a wide range of continuous network-like morphologies, called “polyphorms” -- that the model produces from geometrically intuitive parameters.",

    brief:
      "This work combines two different software tools -- Polyphorm and yet unreleased CosmoVis -- to provide a deep probe into the state-of-the-art simulated cosmological dataset Illustris TNG-100. We explore several modalities of the dataset using these two interactive 3D visualization tools, and present novel results illuminating the relationship between the galaxies' position in the Cosmic Web and their local properties.",
