        brief: "We analyze the observed dispersion measure (DM) of the signal emitted by FRB 190608. The dispersion is caused by interactions of the FRB radiation with matter in the intervening entities: source galaxy and its halo, our galaxy and its halo, and finally the intergalactic medium contained in the Cosmic Web."

        brief: "The initial application of Polyphorm had aimed to establish a complete, calibrated map of the dark matter density field in a sufficiently representative region of space wherein we could study the study the distribution of intergalactic gas (the IGM) relative to the dark matter structures, or Cosmic Web."
