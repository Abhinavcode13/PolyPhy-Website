    name: "Polyphorm: Structural Analysis of Cosmological Datasets via Interactive Physarum Polycephalum Visualization",
    journal:
      "IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (presented at VIS 2020)",

    homepage: false,
    authors: "Oskar Elek, Joseph N. Burchett, J. Xavier Prochaska, Angus G. Forbes",
    brief:
      "This paper summarizes over a year of work on our Polyphorm software: detailed account of the tasks driving our design decisions, full exposition of the MCPM model, and concise explanation of the astronomical use cases. This software has been born out of several lucky accidents and seemingly unlikely connections between several disciplines. We are very excited about the result.",

    journal: "Winner of the Data Challenge @ IEEE Vis Astro 2020",

    homepage: false,
    authors: " Joseph N. Burchett, David Abramov, Oskar Elek, Angus G. Forbes",
    brief:
      "This work combines two different software tools -- Polyphorm and yet unreleased CosmoVis -- to provide a deep probe into the state-of-the-art simulated cosmological dataset Illustris TNG-100. We explore several modalities of the dataset using these two interactive 3D visualization tools, and present novel results illuminating the relationship between the galaxies' position in the Cosmic Web and their local properties.",

    journal: "Artificial Life journal (Winter 2022)",

    homepage: true,
    authors: "Oskar Elek, Joseph N. Burchett, J. Xavier Prochaska, Angus G. Forbes",
    brief:
      "We compare MCPM to Jones’s work on theoretical grounds, and describe a task-specific variant designed for reconstructing the large-scale distribution of gas and dark matter in the Universe known as the Cosmic Web. We first explore MCPM’s self-patterning behavior, showing a wide range of continuous network-like morphologies, called “polyphorms” -- that the model produces from geometrically intuitive parameters.",

    homepage: true,
    authors: " Joseph N. Burchett, Oskar Elek, Nicolas Tejos, J. Xavier Prochaska, Todd M. Tripp, Rongmon Bordoloi, Angus G. Forbes",
    brief:"Modern cosmology predicts that matter in our Universe has assembled today into a vast network of filamentary structures colloquially termed the Cosmic Web. Because this matter is either electromagnetically invisible (i.e., dark) or too diffuse to image in emission, tests of this cosmic web paradigm are limited. Widefield surveys do reveal web-like structures in the galaxy distribution, but these luminous galaxies represent less than 10% of baryonic matter. Statistics of absorption by the intergalactic medium (IGM) via spectroscopy of distant quasars support the model yet have not conclusively tied the diffuse IGM to the web. "},

    homepage: false,
    authors: "Sunil Simha, Joseph N. Burchett, J. Xavier Prochaska, Jay S. Chittidi, Oskar Elek, Nicolas Tejos et al.",
    brief:
      "We analyze the observed dispersion measure (DM) of the signal emitted by FRB 190608. The dispersion is caused by interactions of the FRB radiation with matter in the intervening entities: source galaxy and its halo, our galaxy and its halo, and finally the intergalactic medium contained in the Cosmic Web.",
